### Hi there 👋

<!--
**emmimelon/emmimelon** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on the GPA grind
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a green couch.
